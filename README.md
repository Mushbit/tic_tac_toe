# tic_tac_toe
An amazing tic tac toe game and my first real ruby (and OOP) project!

Created with ruby

https://replit.com/@Mushbit/Tic-Tac-Toe?v=1

# Features
 - Multiplayer
 - Text based error messages and instructions for guidance

# Known Bugs
 - Non so far

# I learned that...?
- I started using a linter (rubocop) for the first time on this project
- Linters can be incredible at steering you to apply propper form to your code
- Linters can be incredible at annoying the living shit out of you
- I can still improve on assigning methods to the correct classes and when to have classes inherit
- DRY code is best
- Revising your plan can be the best way out of a sticky situation
- Array.new(3, Array.new(3, ' ')) creates references (ultra interesting, but caused me a bit of a headache at the time)
- Delivering a working product is very gratifying
 
This project has been inspired by an "The Odin Project" assignment
Variable, method and class names were suggested by chatGPT (nothing else)
